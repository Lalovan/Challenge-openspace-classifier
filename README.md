# Seating Arrangement Script 

## 🏢 Description ℹ️

This project is the first one in my portfolio as an AI & Data Scientist! 🚀 
The project automates the assignment of people to random seats across multiple tables in an openspace, allowing to:
  -organize colleagues randomly across tables;
  -select the number of seats per table and the number of tables;
  -display the seating arrangement in the console;
  -save the seating arrangement to a .csv file (or else) for record-keeping.

The project is implemented in Python and uses object-oriented principles (OOP) with classes for "Seat", "Table", and "Openspace".

## 📲 Usage

Follow these steps to run the script:

1.**Clone the repository**  
   First, clone this repository to your local machine, using the command below:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lalovan/Challenge-openspace-classifier.git
 
2.**Run the script**
   To run the script, execute the `main.py` file from your command line:

    ```bash

3.**Output**
The script reads your input file, and organizes your colleagues to random seat assignments. The resulting seating plan is displayed in your console and also saved to an "output.csv" file in your root directory.
